  ## Installation
  
  In the terminal use "npm i" to download required modules
  
  ## Usage
  
  If you do not already have a seeded employees_db database, I have given a schema and seeds file so you can just copy the SQL and put it in your GUI of choice and run them to get a basic database. I do these steps in the beginning of the video I provided.

  After you have the database, open the employee-tracker folder in your terminal and then use the npm start command to start editing and viewing your database.
